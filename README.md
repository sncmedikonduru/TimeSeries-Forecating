# Time Series Forecasting

This project focuses on time series forecasting, specifically for retail sales, using the M5 Forecasting Competition dataset. The notebook explores various techniques for preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation to generate accurate sales predictions.

## Project Structure

- **Datasets**:
  - `sell_prices.csv`: Contains historical selling prices of items.
  - `calendar.csv`: Provides a mapping between dates and special events.
  - `sales_train_validation.csv`: Historical sales data for products.
  - `sample_submission.csv`: Sample format for competition submissions.

- **Steps Included**:
  1. **Data Loading**:
     - Importing and verifying datasets.
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
     - Understanding data distributions, trends, and anomalies.
  3. **Feature Engineering**:
     - Creating calendar-based and price-related features.
  4. **Time Series Modeling**:
     - Developing forecasting models for multi-step predictions.
  5. **Evaluation and Submission**:
     - Generating submission files based on model outputs.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.7+
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
2. Place the dataset files (`sell_prices.csv`, `calendar.csv`, `sales_train_validation.csv`, `sample_submission.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

## Key Insights

- Historical price trends and calendar features (e.g., promotions, holidays) are critical for accurate predictions.
- Feature engineering plays a vital role in boosting model performance for time series forecasting.

## Results

The notebook generates sales predictions and evaluates them based on metrics provided by the M5 competition.
